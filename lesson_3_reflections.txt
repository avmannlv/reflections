q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
a: when collaborating with others, or working from many places or devices.

q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
a: You only want to pull changes in that you know about and can control.  If 
someone changes something you are not aware of, it will pull that in as well.

q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
a: Fork is a copy of a repository only on the server of github.  Clone is a copy of a repository either on your local computer from the server, or only on the local computer.  A branch is a copy of a repository after changes have been made which creates a new version of the code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
